            <h1>My Pet</h1>
            <p class="am">People have my types of pets around the world some would choose calm pets like cats and others wild
                choose active and energetic pets like dogs. My pet was fish. Although they dont do much, some people have a liking to fish as pets. For me they have very few responsibilities. The downside of having pet fish is that you would need to clean the aquarium daily. You need to make sure the filter/heater is set on a temperature that doen't kill them(I say this from personal experience). Finally, you need to buy the same size fish so that they dont kill each other.</p>
